## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze sales performance, profitability, and growth trends in order to support data-driven business decisions. The dashboard helps identify areas to grow, fix, or stop based on performance metrics.

## Data Source
The dataset contains transactional sales data including:
- Order details
- Sales and profit values
- Product categories and segments
- Regional and time-based information

## Dashboard Architecture
The Power BI dashboard is structured into:
1. Executive Summary – Key KPIs and overall performance
2. Growth Analysis – Sales and profit trends over time
3. Category & Segment Performance – Identifying top and bottom performers
4. Regional Analysis – Geographic profit and growth distribution
5. Risk & Opportunity View – Highlighting declining or loss-making areas

Conditional formatting is used to visually highlight high growth, stagnation, and risk areas.

## Key Insights
- Certain categories and regions drive the majority of profits.
- Some high-sales products generate low or negative profit due to costs or discounting.
- Growth is uneven across regions, indicating opportunities for targeted expansion.

## Business Recommendations
- Grow investment in high-margin and high-growth segments.
- Fix pricing and cost structures in low-margin areas.
- Stop or restructure consistently loss-making products or regions.

## How to Use the Dashboard
- Use slicers to filter by region, category, segment, and date.
- Hover over visuals for detailed tooltips.
- Analyze trends dynamically across all pages.

## Tools Used
- Power BI
